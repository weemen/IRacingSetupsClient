Hello Agent,

Can you refactor the iracing app which makes use of the iRacing API in such a way so that:

1. The application does not crash even if Iracing is not running.
2. When Iracing is started it will register a new session over gRPC. This is a one time action!
All messages that we send over grpc have the same uuidv4 as the one that has been used upon registering 
the session. All sessions registered sessions have unique uuidv4.

3. After the session is registered we want to send the carSetup over gRPC. We only send the carSetup 
in the following situations:

a: It only happens when the session is registered
b: It's a one time action

In the Iracing.proto file you can see how the SendCarSetupRequest should look like. 


After we have send CarSetup the app needs start tracing telemetry. SendTelemetryRequest in 
the Iracing.proto file describes how this message show look like. The send telemetry request
will only be send in the following situations.

a: The player must be on Track
b: The player must have completed his outlap
c: The player must have completed a sector.


The app must be written in python.
